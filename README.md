# Ladder Run

Quick instructions for installing dependencies and starting the development server.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install packages:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ladder_run
npm install
```

Launch the app in development mode using **nodemon**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can override the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
